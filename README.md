# Resistor-cal
This code will help you to calculate 4colors resistors. you can calculate The resistor OHMs by Entering The colors(black, brown, red...)consecutively. This code can save your resistors in a history too. yow will see a menu including:1.Add new resistor  2.show saved resistors 3. exit a basic and solid code using classes and loops hope you enjoy it.
